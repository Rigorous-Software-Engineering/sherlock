// This is a pattern we saw in some examples for SVCOMP, where instead of the
// __goblint_check(0) there was a call to verifier error. Because of the
// demand-driven nature of our solvers, we never looked at the code inside fail
// since there is no edge from the loop to the endpoint of f. However, the
// __goblint_check(0) (verifier error) is still reachable from main.

  __goblint_check(0); // FAIL
  goto fail;
